"""
Letâ€™s consider a more complicated problem, called SS: Given a set X
of positive integers and target integer T, is there a subset of elements in X that
add up to T? Notice that there can be more than one such subset. For example,
if X = {8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 10, 9} and T = 15, the answer is True, because the subsets
{8, 7} and {7, 5, 3} and {6, 9} and {5, 10} all sum to 15. On the other hand, if
X = {11, 6, 5, 1, 7, 13, 12} and T = 15, the answer is False.
